## 🚀 The QUICK-START Protocol

### Step 1: Problem Classification (30 seconds)

Ask these questions in order:

1. **Do I have a target variable?**
    - Yes → Supervised Learning
    - No → Unsupervised Learning
2. **Is my target categorical or numeric?**
    - Categorical → Classification
    - Numeric → Regression
3. **Is my data sequential/time-based?**
    - Yes → Time Series
    - No → Continue with above logic

### Step 2: Algorithm Selection (60 seconds)

Use the **"START SIMPLE"** rule:

- **S**tart with baseline (Linear/Logistic Regression)
- **T**est robust middle-ground (Random Forest)
- **A**dvanced if needed (XGBoost/Neural Networks)
- **R**epeat with best performer
- **T**une hyperparameters


### Step 3: Validation Strategy (30 seconds)

**Memory Hook: "SPLIT"**

- **S**eparate train/validation/test
- **P**erform cross-validation
- **L**ook at multiple metrics
- **I**terate based on results
- **T**est on unseen data

### The "NEVER FORGET" Rules

1. **Garbage in, garbage out** - Data quality beats algorithm complexity
2. **Cross-validate everything** - Single splits lie
3. **Business context matters** - Perfect accuracy might not be the goal
4. **Monitor model performance** - Models decay over time
5. **Document your decisions** - Future you will thank present you

### Emergency Algorithm Selection

**When in doubt, try this sequence:**

1. **Regression problems:** Linear → Random Forest → XGBoost
2. **Classification problems:** Logistic → Random Forest → XGBoost
3. **Clustering problems:** K-Means → Hierarchical → DBSCAN
4. **Time series problems:** Simple average → ARIMA → LSTM
